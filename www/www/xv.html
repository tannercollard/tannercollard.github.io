   <h1>Travels</h1>  
 
  <p>I've been traveling aorund the world for as long as I can remember. It's probably my favorite thing to do and I plan on travelling around the world for the rest of my life. I was fortunate enough to grow up in an upper-middle class family that could afford a yearly vacation. I've travelled to most of the caribbean Islands with my fmamily on various vactions to resorts there as well as various cruises around the caribbean. I much prefer going on a cruise as opposed to going to a resort. With cruises you go to multiple places, not just one island and on top of that while you're not on an Island, you're on the boat and they're plenty of things and activities to keep one occupied on a ship. </P>

  <p>As mentioned above, I've traveled to most islands in the Caribbean, but i've also made a few visit acroos the Alantic to Europe and Africa. When I was 13, I went on a school trip to Ghana, Africa. On this trip, our school participated in a chior festival, I don't sing nor was in chior at that time. I went because I was presented with an oppartunity to travel to a place I had never been before, so I was all about it. My past two big travels have been to Spain, to visit friends. The highschool I graduated from had, and still has a large amount of international students enrolled. Through this, I met a bunch of people from all around the world, but mostly Europe. I dated a girl from Spain as well as became very good friends with a Spainish guy. Meeting and becoming close with these two was the main reason for my two travels to Spain. I went for three weeks in the summer of 2016, and two weeks in the summmer of 2017 to visit. These two trips have been my favorite in awhile, moslty because I wasn't neccessarily going there as a tourest to do touristy things, instead I was there as a tourist living the lifestyle of a Spainish teenager through my friends. Spain is a great place and i've had a lot of fun there and am very glad I have friends there so I always have a reaon to go. </p>

 <p>I was born and raised in Maine, and love the state that I grew up in. The seasons are beutiful and they're many activities to take part in. As much I love my home state, I love to experience different environments and cultures too. This is what I get out of travelling. The ability to go to a new place around the wolrd and experience how life is lived there and what the people of that place do to occupy themsleves. There are many palces I havn't been to and plan on going to those places in the future. </P>
