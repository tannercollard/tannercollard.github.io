 <p>My grandparents bought a camp on Sebago lake in 1978. The camp they bought then, looks very different now, and has been in my family since. I absolutly love my camp, it's my summer home and I cound't be more greatful that it's in my family and that I am able to spend so much time there. I've spent every summer of my life at that camp with my family and friends. I enjoy bringing my friends up to my camp so that they can experience what I have my whole life. I have two boats, ones a fishing boat and the other is a 26 foot bowrider. I love going out on the boat with friedns and cruising around the lake, finding rocks to jump and participating in water sports such as, tubing, kneeboarding, and water skiing. My favorite is kneeboarding.  </p> 
 
 <p>On the property we have two camps, ones for the family and the other we rent throughout the summer. We have a garge with two floors above with a bunch of rooms and beds for guest. My dad has built two bars, one on the water, the other in the backyard for entertainment. Along with all the buildings we have over 200 feet of beach with two docks, one for each camp. Its quite the compound and I enjoy going up throughout the summer with family and friends to enjoy all that we have up there. My friends really enjoy coming up too, we alwasy find somthing to do. My camp has been and will continue to be a huge part of my life, being able to enjoy with friends and family is awesome. </p>
