 <H1>Hello, I'm Tanner Collard</H1><h2></h2>
<p> <img src="yo.jpg" width="400"> </P>

<P>Welcome to my website! I am freshman at the Univeristy of Maine, currently studying toward a business degree. I graduated from Thornton Academy Highschool, in Saco, Maine. I'm excited to be in college, it's been a long journey to get here and i've had a lot of fun along the way and looking forward for more to come. </P>  

<p>Heres a little bit about myself, and things I enjoy doing. I grew up in a small town, in a peaceful neighborhood, in a spacious house on a quiet piece of property. I have one older brother who is the opposite of me in most to every way. Along with the one brother, I have a loveing and supportive family that does a lot for me. I have a lakehouse on Sebago lake in Maine, I enjoy spending time there in the summers and have been ever since I was a child. The camp means a lot to me and has been in the fmaily for some years now. On the opposite end, in the winters I enjoy skiing. I absolutly love it! I learned how to ski when I was youger and always get at a thrill from whiping down the slopes. Above all the things that I enjying doing with my time, traveling is probably the thing I enjoy the most. I've traveled to a lot of places throughout the years and alwyas look forward to a good vacation.   </P>
