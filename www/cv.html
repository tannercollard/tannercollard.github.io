 <p> I played a few sports in highschool and enjoy practicing hobbys of mine. Here, I will share some of the sports that i've played and the hobbys I take part in. </p>
 
 <p> In highschool I played two sports, football and frisbee. I played football all four years of highschool and throughout those four years, I was apart of two state championship teams. We won my sophmore and junior year, and though I never got to play in either one of those games due to being 2nd string and injury, I still enjoyed the experience. Football in highscool was a lot of fun and good times but with those came a lot of time and effort, on and off the feild. I played special teams, saftey, and wide receiver. I was never really the big guy on the team or that strong, but I was quick, agile, and aggressive. The thing i'll miss most about highschool football is the huge crowd of spectators and fans that would be sitting in the stands chanting and rooting the two teams on, it's a great feeling and experience. I started playing football when I was younger, my dad got me into it since he played in highschool as well. Im glad he did so becuase i've loved the sport ever since and enjoy the adrenaline rush and intensitiy of the game. </p>

<p>I also played club frisbee in hihschool. in my junior year, my friends and I created a club frisbee team through the school. We loved playing backyard friz and being able to compete agnist other teams was a great opportunity for us, we really enjoyed it. It was especially nice that I am friends with every member that was on the team and hungout with them on a regular basis. And though our season was short, we made the most of it and enjoyed ever bit of it. Here's a team photo of us our first year playing.   </p>

 <p> I have lots of hobbys such as, fishing, wood carving, hanging with friends, kneeboarding, dowhill skiing, frisbee, and card gamees. Out of all of these hobbys, I like skiing the most and do it the most frequently. I've been skiing for as long as I remember, it's a great way to spend the day with friends and family. I usually ski with friends, a few of mine have condos up by mountians such as Sunday River and Sugarloaf. I go up as often as I can and always enjoy a weekend on the mountian, it's my favorite way to spend a winter weekend.    </p>
